> Cyberpunk: Edgerunners
Cyberpunk: Edgerunners is a tv series produced by Studio TRIGGER and published by netflix. It is set Night City, a dystopian futuristic capitalistic city where everything and everyone is against everybody and everybody is controlled by corporations. The story follows a young boy named David Martinez and his goal of being one of night city's living legends. He wants to become an *Edgerunner*, someone who augments their bodies with technology to do legal and illegal businesses. This series is a 10 episode thrill ride that I highly recommend.
