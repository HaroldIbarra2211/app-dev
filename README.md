# Cyberpunk:Edgerunners
> The main sypnosis is: 
*In a Futuristic distopian cyty overrun by corruption, crime, and cybernetic implants, an impulsive but talented street kid named David, after losing everything he has in a drive-by shooting, makes the choice to survive on the wrong side of the law as an **"edgerunner"**: a high-tech, black-market mercenary also known as a "cyberpunk". They are called edgerunners as they are "living on the edge", meaning that at any point of their job they may die, metaphorically falling off the edge.*
